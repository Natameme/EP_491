# Arduino Sketches

this folder contains WIP sketches for interfacing arduino sensors with Supercollider.

The 3 types of sensors being used are

I2C CO2/Temperature/Humidity Sensor: for quantifying the number of people in the space

Ultrasonic Array: for measuring the position of people in the space, further experimentation needs to be done with best practice for positioning

Theremin Antenna: Interface a Doepfer A-187 Theremin Module with the Arduino Using the Analog Input. Both proximity and Gate outputs will be used.
